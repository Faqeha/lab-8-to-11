Project Proposal
Interactive Rectangle and Point Representation using Python
Objective:
To create an interactive Python-based application that allows users to visually and computationally interact with geometric shapes. The project enables users to guess if a point falls within a randomly generated rectangle and calculates how accurate their area estimation is.
Key Features:
1. Point and Rectangle Classes:
- Encapsulation of geometric properties.
- Functions to check relationships between points and rectangles.
2. Graphical Visualization:
- Representation of rectangles and points using the Turtle graphics module.
- Interactive dot placement and rectangle drawing.
3. User Interaction:
- Randomized rectangle generation.
- User input for guessing coordinates and rectangle area.
- Feedback on accuracy and correctness.
Technical Stack:
- Language: Python
- Libraries Used: turtle, random
Outcomes:
This project aims to demonstrate concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP), graphical representation, and user interaction in Python. It also reinforces mathematical reasoning by integrating basic geometry concepts.
